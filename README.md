CodeCademy ruby final project
This is my code cademy final project for their ruby course. If you are reading from a file that you have not written to then replace the code under the read_from_file method with IO.readlines(file).each { |line| add(Task.new(line.chomp)) and it should readit fine. When reading from a file that you have written to then use the current code under the read_from_file method.
